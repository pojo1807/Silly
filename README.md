Welcome to **Silly Bot**!

This project is uploaded here because I don‚Äôt have a hosting server... and also because I *love* silly cats! 

It‚Äôs a simple, fun project I use for myself. If more people get interested, I might put more effort into making it better. üêæ

## Installation

I don't intend for this to be a "for everyone" project - it's more like my personal **project, challenge, and joy**. However, if you want to install this Bot, I've added the `_Emojis` folder for you to add to the Bot to make installation **much easier** (OBVIOUSLY MUCH EASIER :P)

If there's more interest, I might make it a bit more "*for everyone*". **Thank you**!

## Features

Currently, this bot doesn't have too many features since it was just coded recently (about 5 days ago). However, it does have a working `ban` command!

Here's what it looks like in action:

And of course, there's also the `help` command which looks like this:

# TODO
What I plan to do:
- Add more commands, currently only have `ban` and `help` commands.
- Focus on fun, silly, and generally CAT-related content (might add some dogs too, I've seen some that are cute and hilarious).
- Optimize and clean up the code.
- Add slash command for `help`.
- Add `CImages` class to make using GIFs and images easier instead of using URLs.

# AI Detected
Yeah, you're right. I used **ChatGPT** to write this README because I'm not good at English :). (nh√¨n ph√°t bi·∫øt AI lu√¥n hehe)

**"But what about your code? I see some AI usage there too!"**

- Yup, I also use [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) when coding sometimes. So if you see traces of AI help... well... let's just say my relationship status with AI is "It's complicated" ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏è (i code alot tho). xd
