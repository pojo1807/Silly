# Silly Bot

Welcome to **Silly Bot**!

This project is uploaded here because I don‚Äôt have a hosting server... and also because I *love* silly cats! It‚Äôs a simple, fun project I use for myself. If more people get interested, I might put more effort into making it better. üêæ

## Installation

This project is still in an early stage and has limited functionality. It's mostly for personal use, but I‚Äôve added a `_Emojis` folder to make setup a bit easier.

I haven‚Äôt written a full installation guide yet, because... well, almost nobody is looking at this project. üòÖ

### Some parameters when running `Bot.py`:

Yeah, there's no install guide, but I can still tell you how to run it. XD

```bash
python Bot.py -h
```

- `-h`: Shows help for all available parameters.
---
```bash
python Bot.py --sync <GUILD_ID>
```

- `--sync`: Syncs commands to a specific server. For example:
```bash
python Bot.py --sync 1091675679994675240
```
---
 ```bash
python Bot.py --debug
```

- `--debug`: Sets logging level to DEBUG.

# TODO
What I plan to do:
- Add more commands (currently it only has one: ban üôÉ).
- Focus on fun, silly cat-related content like random cat facts or images.
- Add support for dynamic prefixes per server if more users show interest.

# AI Detected
Yeah, you're right. I used **ChatGPT** to write this README because I'm not good at English :). (nh√¨n ph√°t bi·∫øt AI lu√¥n)

**‚ÄúBut what about your code? I see some AI usage there too!‚Äù**

- Yup, I also use [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.com/) when coding sometimes. So if you see traces of AI help, uh (i code alot). xd
