## 🌟 Welcome to Silly Bot!

This project found its home on GitHub not just because I needed hosting, but because I absolutely *adore* silly cats! It's a passion project that brings joy to my coding journey. While it started as a personal endeavor, who knows? With enough interest, it might grow into something bigger! 🐾

## 🚀 Installation

While Silly Bot is primarily my personal playground for coding fun and challenges, I've included the `_Emojis` folder to make installation smoother for anyone interested in trying it out. The more the merrier! 

## ✨ Features

Though young (just about 5 days old!), Silly Bot already has some tricks up its sleeve. Check out our star command:

### 🛡️ Ban Command

- [x] Code optimization and cleanup (Improved code organization and structure)
- [x] Slash command implementation for `help` (Fully implemented with autocomplete)
- [ ] Implement `CImages` class for better media management

## 🤖 AI Disclosure
Yes, this README got some help from ChatGPT because English isn't my strong suit!

**"What about the code?"**

I do use [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) sometimes, so there might be some AI fingerprints in there. Let's just say my relationship with AI is "It's complicated" 🤖❤️ (but I do write most of the code myself!). xd
