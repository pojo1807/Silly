## 🌟 Welcome to Silly Bot!

This isn’t just a bot. It’s a silly, chaotic cat-shaped bundle of joy built with ❤️ and caffeine.  
What started as a fun little project (because cats are awesome) might just become your next favorite bot. Maybe. Possibly. We’ll see.

## 🤖 AI Involvement

Yes, some parts were enhanced using AI — but the soul, code, and chaos are 100% me.  
No rules were broken, just limits pushed.
